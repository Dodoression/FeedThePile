## **Introduction**

Feed The Pile! is a delightful 2D platformer where the goal is to collect food and feed it to a growing chicken. It was created as a personal project for a special occasion and brings joy through it's lighthearted gameplay and charming visuals. 
The project is my first finished project made in Godot Engine.
The main characters and boss were both designed and drawn by me using Aseprite. The whole project was designed, put together and developed in the span of 3 days.
